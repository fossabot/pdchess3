## Building `pdchess3`

To build `pdchess3` and install the command-line interface, do this:

```console
npm run all
npm link
```

## Launching `pdchess3`

After `npm link` has been run, `pdchess3` can be invoked from the command line using this syntax:

```console
pdchess3 [White player configuration] [Black player configuration]
```

... where each player's configuration is in one of two forms:

- h: Human. The player's moves will be entered via the standard input.
- c [max ply]: Computer. The player's moves will be calculated by `pdchess`'s game engine, using 'max ply' as the initial basic maximum lookahead depth.

For example, if you want to play White while the computer plays Black, you could do this:

```console
pdchess3 h c 5
```

If you want the computer to play a slow game against itself, you could do this:

```console
pdchess3 c 6 c 6
```

You can use `nice` to launch the `pdchess3` process with a lower priority; e.g.:

```console
nice -n 20 pdchess3 c 5 c 5
```

## Playing `pdchess3`

A fairly standard command syntax is used to specify moves; e.g.:

- e2-e4 : An initial pawn move by White
- Ng8-f6 : An initial knight move by Black
- Qa1xd8 : A capturing move by a queen
- O-O : Castle on the kingside
- O-O-O : Castle on the queenside

Type 'exit' at the move prompt to end the game and exit the app.

## History

- I witnessed the University of Waterloo host a tournament of Othello (Reversi)-playing programs in 1992; these programs played each other by sending game data over the Internet.
- After creating my own rudimentary Othello-playing program in C, I chose chess as the next problem domain to tackle. The result was [incarnation number 1](https://github.com/tom-weatherhead/pdchess1) of pdchess, which was written in C in 1993. I began the project during my university exams in April. This version had a console interface. I started developing it on the univerity's Unix computers, then e-mailed the source code to my e-mail address at Digital Equipment of Canada in Ottawa, where I worked during the summer of 1993. At Digital, I ported the code to compile and run on the VAX/VMS operating system, and I continued development. In August 1993, I e-mailed the source code back to Waterloo. Just before finishing my final term in April 1994, I copied the source code to a 3.5-inch floppy and took it with me.
- During the summer of 1994, I modified the code to work on my brand-new computer (an Intel 80486SX PC clone running Windows 3.1, with 640 KB + 3072 KB of RAM and a 360 MB hard drive, plus 3.5-inch and 5.25-inch floppy drives) via Borland Turbo C++ 3.1. I created a GUI for pdchess using Turbo C++'s OWL (Object Windows Library) framework. (OWL was analogous to Microsoft's MFC.)
- Incarnation number 2 of pdchess was written in C++ in 2002, after I had read Bjarne Stroustrup's book on the language.
- Incarnation number 3 of pdchess was written in Typescript in Beijing, China in February and March 2020, during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.
- pdchess is also known to some as 'partly done chess'. :-)
